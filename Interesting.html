        <p>
            I went to art school for 7 years, where I learned to draw and think creatively.</br>
            It helps me a lot when writing, creating design sites.
            Since the beginning of our studies we have studied back-end (c, c++, java).</br>
            I didnâ€™t really like these programming languages, I wanted something very creative,</br>
            but connected with programming.</br>
            And at the end of the second year, there was a subject in which we began to learn the layout of websites.</br>
            I really liked it and I realized that it was here that I would be able to show my thinking and creativity.</br>
            So began my way in front-end development))
